# Smart-greenhouse

## About project

Smart greenhouse is an IoT project. The idea is to have a modern greenhouse thermometer that allows people to measure temperature from a distance. When the temperature is not optimal, the green bulb on the execution side will turn on and on the control side, the user will get an alert that needs to regulate the temperature. Also, users have pieces of information about humidity.

## Components

• Control side: Website created using HTML, CSS and JS. With the website, users can monitor temperature and humidity
• Execution side: ESP8266, DHT11, led bulb
• Database: Real-Time database - Firebase
